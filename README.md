We are automating the sending of emails too with the AI generated email content. Here we are using our gmail to automatically send the emails. 
Remember to create an account on AI21 and get their api key to access their Jurassic model, the email and google account app password of that email should be saved in the .env file.
We access them in the code to send the mail.

To read a csv file of contacts lists containing the name email and description of the lead/contact/recipient and send customised AI generated emails to each of them based on an intention we input to the script.
